# HuddyDesign-Portfolio
I designed this portfolio to showcase my skills in UI/UX design, branding, and digital product interfaces using Figma. It includes mobile and web designs, creative layouts, and real-world project samples. Each project demonstrates my understanding of user flow, visual hierarchy, and responsive design. Tools Used: Figma, Adobe Photoshop.
